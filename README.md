## Introduction

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical and demographic data.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains several attributes related to patient health and demographics, including:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia

## Methods

The project employs the following methodologies:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To visualize and understand the data distributions and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:** Scaling and encoding of features to prepare data for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict heart disease.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The predictive model achieved significant accuracy in identifying patients with heart disease. Key factors influencing the predictions were identified, providing insights into the most important health indicators.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in the healthcare sector, particularly in the early detection of heart disease. The insights gained from the analysis can aid in developing preventive strategies and personalized treatment plans.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks provided. Each notebook contains detailed explanations and code snippets for data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
